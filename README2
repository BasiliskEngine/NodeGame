# Todo: camera (DONE)
# Todo: Subtiles to show units, resources, and owners on tiles
# Todo: store on server which client's turn is to go. (Possibly not everybody has their turn at the same time)
# Todo: NOTE: send minimal data in packets on server and client
	# (ex: tile id and new type, not all the map data just because one tile was changed)
# Todo: Send separate packet from server to client when sending map data after the client has received the initial data
	# This packet will probably be sent to all clients because the data is constantly being sent whenever the map is changed
	# This packet may only be sent after the end of the universal turns if I decided to use that system
# Todo: Better packet sending framework on client using Middle class (sort of done)
# Todo: tile sprites (DONE)
# Todo: Style sheets (DONE)
# Todo: Write new map data to JSON file (DONE)
# Todo: Limit frames (60) (DONE)
# Todo: game states, loading, and like game, and like turn, and like stuff, and like explore other lands idek
<***># Todo: Better authentication framework with session tokens and stuff (DONE SORT OF)
# Todo: Don't unit a tile that has already been united (or do something special)
# Todo: Modify map data once a tile has been united (DONE)
# Todo: Server framework to send data for only one tile to the client
	# Todo: Framework on client to change just this one tile (handle in Middle?)
# Todo: Add quick way to deunit all tiles in JSON file
# Todo: Add quicker way to write to JSON map data file whenevr a tile is united (Probably modify instead of rewriting entire file)
# Todo: Debug by logging tile owner of (marked/united) tile when hovering over it (on client)
# Todo: Change so that new units are only written (on the hour?)
	# Therefore: don't write map data to JSON file on networking events, write on the hour
# Todo: United tiles have no owner (owner: server)?
# Todo: Write client system so that if you hover over tile it shows owner

# Todo FIX: Csrf token not defined when authentication error is thrown? (fix)
